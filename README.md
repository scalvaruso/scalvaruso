<h1 align='center'>Introduction</h1>
<div align='justify'>
<p>Greetings!</p>
<p>I'm Simon, a passionate software engineer with background in retail and information technology. With deep enthusiasm for data science, I am dedicated to advancing the field of information technology through innovative solutions.</p>
<p>Completing the "Introduction to Programming with Python" course offered by HarvardX, which further solidified my technical foundation, helped me to secure a place in a coding bootcamp backed by the Department for Education, provided by HyperionDev. During the bootcamp, I had the opportunity to sharpen my skills, particularly in data analysis, solution design, and Python development for industry-standard projects.</p>
<p>My technical proficiency encompasses a range of tools and technologies, including Bootstrap, C++, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), Dash, Django, Git, GitHub, HTML, JSON, Linux, Microsoft Power BI, Natural Language Processing (NLP), OOP, Plotly, PostgreSQL, Python, Pytest, SQL, Ubuntu, and Visual Studio. I am well-versed in software development methodologies, testing, and debugging techniques.</p>
<p>Throughout my journey, I have successfully completed several notable projects. One such project is "Borders 1.0.3," an open-source Python library that simplifies the creation of borders in Python, enhancing the visualizations of lists and other texts representations. Another project, "What to Watch Next," utilizes Natural Language Processing to help users select movies based on the description of their last watched film. Additionally, I have developed programs such as "Inventory" and "Task Manager" to streamline processes and improve productivity.</p>
<p>Aside from my professional endeavours, I am an avid computer programming enthusiast, intrigued by foreign languages and cultures, and fascinated by the world of multimedia and technology.</p>
<p>I am now actively seeking a challenging role as a Python/software developer, where I can leverage my extensive experience and newfound knowledge to contribute to innovative projects. Feel free to explore my GitHub repositories and portfolios for a closer look at my work.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time, and I look forward to connecting with fellow professionals in the industry.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br>
Simon</p>
